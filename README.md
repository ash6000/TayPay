# TabaPay Interview Project

This project is intended for the TabaPay interview process.

To run this application, you will need to download Xcode and run it on a simulator.

For testing purposes, I have included the SDK as a file titled 'PaymentSDK', located within the project itself, so no additional setup is required for it to run.

In a professional environment, this file would typically be a separate library that needs to be imported into the project.

Below is the link to a video demonstrating the functionality of the app:
